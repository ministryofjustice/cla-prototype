  <h1>Do you qualify for legal aid?</h1>
  <p>Use this checker to see if you can get legal aid and find out where to go next for help.</p>
</header>

<p>Legal aid can help you cover the cost of legal advice, get someone to speak for you in court or help you resolve family problems.</p>

<p><strong>You'll only get legal aid if you are at immediate risk of serious harm, losing your home or if you have very limited money.</strong></p>

<h2>Before you start</h2>

<p>This checker is for non-criminal cases only. If you've been charged with a crime ask your solicitor about legal aid.</p>

<p>This checker assesses if you qualify for legal aid in England and Wales only.</p>

<p>All information you provide is confidential and will not be shared.</p>
