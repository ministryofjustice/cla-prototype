<p>You're about to check if you can get legal aid. You must provide detailed information about your income, your savings, your property, any benefits you receive and also your partner's details.</p>

<ul>
   <li>your most recent pay-slips</li>
   <li>your most recent bank statements</li>
   <li>details of any benefits you receive</li>
 </ul>
